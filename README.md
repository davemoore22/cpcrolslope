An Intro for a proposed remake of Horace goes Skiing for the Amstrad 6128 PLUS entitled "Roland on the Slopes". 

Written using CPCTeleraNext. Needs a 6128 Plus.

Main game may come along later in 2026, possibly.

Written mainly to learn to code with the Plus. It features:

* HW Sprites
* Bank-Switching
* AT3 Music
* Direct Disk Access using FDCTools

Only things not implemented out of the standard set of Plus Features are:

* HW Scrolling
* Screen Ruptures.

But the main game will have those, when I get round to coding it.
